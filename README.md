# Genesis Sample Theme

Github original project link: https://github.com/copyblogger/genesis-sample

Modified from Sridhar's Genesis Starter theme: 
https://sridharkatakam.com/genesis-starter-child-theme

Now includes a Widgetized Front Page Layout and Build Tools.

Very basic Genesis Child Theme set up, based on the Sample theme, with all CSS properties and values commented out ( but left for reference).

Thus, you're left with an "exoskeleton" of selectors. The frame is there, but there's not much else.

So you get to add (or un-comment) all the tasty, meaty goodness that is CSS.

This this meant to mimic the __'s experience of building a theme from scratch, for the Genesis Framework.

Bon appetite!
