# Genesis Exoskeleton

Very basic Genesis Child Theme set up, based on the Sample theme, with all CSS properties and values commented out ( but left for reference). 

Thus, you're left with an "exoskeleton" of selectors. The frame is there, but there's not much else. 

So you get to add (or un-comment) all the tasty, meaty goodness that is CSS. 

This this meant to mimic the __'s experience of building a theme from scratch, for the Genesis Framework. 

Bon appetite!
