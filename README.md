# Genesis Exoskeleton

Very basic Genesis Child Theme set up, based on the Sample theme, with all CSS properties and values commented out ( but left for reference). 

Thus, you're left with an "exoskeleton" of selectors. The frame is there, but there's not much in there. 

So you get to add all the tasty-goodness that is the CSS meat.

Bon appetite!
